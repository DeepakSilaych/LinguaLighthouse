# React i18n Tutorial: i18next and react-i18next

## Why i18next?

When it comes to React localization, one of the most popular choices is i18next, accompanied by its React extension, react-i18next. There are several reasons why i18next is a preferred option:

- **Sustainable:** i18next has been available as open source since late 2011, making it older than many other libraries used in frontend technologies like React or Vue.

- **Mature:** With its long history, i18next has proven itself capable of solving various i18n cases, making it a mature and reliable choice.

- **Extensible:** i18next offers a plethora of features and possibilities compared to other regular i18n frameworks.

- **Rich:** The capabilities of i18next extend beyond standard i18n frameworks, making it a versatile choice for different scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Prior experience with basic HTML, JavaScript, and React.js is recommended before diving into react-i18next.
